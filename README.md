<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Network Protocols</h1>
In this tutorial, we will observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups.👀 

<h2>💻 Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute/Firewall)
- Remote Desktop
- Windows App (macOS)
- PowerShell
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>👨‍💻 Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 Pro
- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04
- 
<h2>🪜 High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Connect to VM using RDP & Install Wireshark
- Step 2: Observe ICMP Traffic
- Step 3: Use NSG (Firewall) to Deny Ping
- Step 4: Observe SSH and DHCP Traffic
- Step 5: Observe DNS and RDP Traffic
