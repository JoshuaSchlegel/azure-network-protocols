<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Network Protocols</h1>
A security-focused project demonstrating the configuration and analysis of Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and the inspection of network protocols to enforce access controls and monitor network traffic. 👀 

- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** → These are core components of cloud security (especially in Azure). They control inbound/outbound traffic at the subnet or NIC level — that's fundamental to network access control and segmentation.

- **Inspecting Network Protocols** → This involves analyzing how data flows over the network, identifying potential vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or unusual traffic patterns. That’s classic security ops / defensive security / monitoring territory.

<h2>💻 Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute/Firewall)
- Remote Desktop
- Windows App (macOS)
- PowerShell
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>👨‍💻 Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 Pro
- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04
- 
<h2>🪜 High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Create Virtual Machines and Connect to VMs using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) & Install Wireshark
- Step 2: Observe ICMP Traffic
- Step 3: Use NSG (Firewall) to Deny Ping
- Step 4: Observe SSH and DHCP Traffic
- Step 5: Observe DNS and RDP Traffic

<h2>🎬 Actions and Observations</h2>
